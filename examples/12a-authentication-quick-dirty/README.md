## Getting Started

You will need to have two terminal windows open and running at once. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can click on the split-screen or plus icon in your terminal panel:

In one terminal window, you will need to run the authentication server. Please follow the _Getting Started_ steps [in this README.md](../../authentication-server/README.md) on how to install and start the authentication server.

In the other terminal window, you will need to navigate to the this folder, install all dependencies, and start this example.

```bash
cd examples/12a-authentication-quick-dirty/
yarn install
yarn start
```

If, at any time, you need to stop the app, press `ctrl+c`.
